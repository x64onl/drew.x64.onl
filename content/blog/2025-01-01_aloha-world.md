I am a [computer security architect](/resume) by trade. Occasionally, I lend a hand to the public as an [independent researcher](https://x64.onl/author/drew). These days I've been focused on [crafting communities](https://x64.onl/community) and [democratizing cyber research](https://x64.onl/about).

Things you should know about me:

- **💡 Tinkerer at heart**: I have an insatiable curiosity for new ideas and tech. My lab is where I explore, test theories, build prototypes, and constantly push the boundaries of what I know.

- **🧠 Lifelong learner**: Technology never stands still, and neither do I. Whether it’s through formal education or online deep dives, I believe in always adapting, learning, and forging ahead.

- **🌐 Advocate of group thought**: I believe that shared knowledge and collective experiences make us all stronger. Encouraging open discussions, developing feedback loops, and collaboration across communities is something I deeply value.

If there’s one thing I hope you take away from my work, it’s the inspiration to start your own journey—no matter how small it may seem at first. You might surprise yourself with how far you can go once you find your flow.
