I'm Drew, a cyber engineer with a passion for security, privacy, and sentient rights. I love collaborating with cybercitizens across academic, public, and private sectors to create positive change for the next generation. I often contribute my knowledge and insights to the cyber community through blogs, publications, and other public efforts like [X64.ONL: The Independent Security Publication](https://x64.onl/).
